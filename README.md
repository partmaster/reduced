The 'reduced' package defines a minimal API for the basic features of state management frameworks.

1. Read and update a current state value.
2. Register a state for management.
3. Trigger a rebuild on widgets selectively after a state change.
4. Set up a new scope for state management.

There are dozens of state management frameworks and each provides its own API for these basic features. The app logic mainly needs to read and update the current app state value and should remain as independent as possible from the state management framework used. So the app logic needs a neutral state management API and an implementation of this API for the used state management framework.
The former is provided by this package. The latter is provided by other packages listed at the end of the README.

## Features

The 'reduced' API covers the following features of a state management framework:

1. Read and update a current state value.

```dart
abstract class Reducible {
    S get state;
    void reduce(Reducer<S> reducer);
}
```

Instead of writing the state value directly, the API provides a ```reduce``` method that accepts a so-called ```reducer``` as a parameter. 
In the ```reduce``` method the ```reducer``` is executed with the current state value as a paramerter and the return value of the ```reducer``` is stored as the new state value.

```dart
abstract class Reducer<S> {
    S call(S state);
}
```

2. Register a state for management.

```dart
void registerState(S initialValue);
```

```dart
Widget wrapWithProvider<S>({required S initialState, required Widget child}});
```

3. Trigger a rebuild on widgets selectively after a state change.

```dart
Widget wrapWithConsumer({
    required ReducedTransformer<S, P> transformer,
    required ReducedWidgetBuilder<P> builder,
});
```

A ```ReducedTransformer``` is a ```Function``` that uses the read and update methods of the ```reducible``` parameter to transform the current state value into a derived ```selective``` state value. Only the changes to this derived 'selective' state value determine whether a rebuild of the widget is triggered. In order for changes to be detected correctly, the derived 'selective' state value must have value semantics.

```dart
typedef ReducedTransformer<S, P> = P Function(Reducible<S> reducible);
```

A ```ReducedWidgetBuilder``` is a ```Function``` that builds a new widget from the properties of the passed ```props``` parameter. That is, the ```props``` parameter must contain all the properties necessary for building the widget.

```dart
typedef ReducedWidgetBuilder<P> = Widget Function({required P props});
```

4. Set up a new scope for state management.

```dart
Widget wrapWithScope({required Widget child});
```

The specific signature of the functions ```registerState```, ```wrapWithProvider```, ```wrapWithConsumer``` and ```wrapWithScope``` depends on the state management framework for which the functions are implemented, therefore, these functions are only provided by the implementations of this API for a state management framework.

So the 'reduced' API itself consists only of the classes ```Reducer``` and ```Reducible```. There are also classes ```Callable```, ```Callable1```, ```Callable2``` and ```Callable3```.

```dart
abstract class Callable<T> {
    T call();
}
```

```dart
abstract class Callable1<T, V> {
    T call(V value);
}
```

```dart
abstract class Callable2<T, V1, V2> {
    T call(V1 value1, V2 value2);
}
```

```dart
abstract class Callable3<T, V1, V2, V3> {
    T call(V1 value1, V2 value2, V3 value3);
}
```

The ```Callable``` classes serve as base classes for callback property values ​​in the derived 'selective' state values ​​generated by ```ReducedTransformer``` functions.
Many widgets have callback properties of type ```Function```. The ```Function``` type has no value semantics (each function is unique), this also applies to anonymous functions, which are often used as values ​​for widget callback properties.
To grant value semantics, ```Callable``` can be used in the derived 'selective' state values ​​instead of anonymous functions.
If the signatures of a widget callback property's function and the ```call``` method of a ```callable``` match, then the ```callable``` is assignment-compatible with the widget callback property, e.g.:

```dart
Callable1<String?, String> validator = ...
TextFormField(
    validator: validator,
    ...
);

```

## Getting started

In the pubspec.yaml add dependencies on the package 'reduced' and on the package of an implementation of the 'reduced' API for a state management framework, e.g. 'reduced_bloc'.

## Usage

Implementation of the counter demo app logic with the 'reduced' API without further dependencies on state management packages.

```dart
// logic.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reduced/reduced.dart';

class Incrementer extends Reducer<int> {
  int call(int state) => state + 1;
}

class Props {
  Props({required this.counterText, required this.onPressed});
  final String counterText;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
}

Props transformer(Reducible<int> reducible) => Props(
      counterText: '${reducible.state}',
      onPressed: () => reducible.reduce(Incrementer()),
    );

Widget builder({Key? key, required Props props}) => Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('reduced_bloc example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text('${props.counterText}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: props.onPressed,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
```

Using logic.dart with the implementation of the 'reduced' API for Bloc.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import 'package:reduced/reduced.dart';
import 'package:reduced_bloc/reduced_bloc.dart';
import 'package:reduced_bloc/reduced_bloc_wrapper.dart';
import 'logic.dart';

void main() => runApp(
      wrapWithProvider(
        initialState: 0,
        child: MaterialApp(
          theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
          home: Builder(
            builder: (context) => context.bloc<int>().wrapWithConsumer(
                  transformer: transformer,
                  builder: builder,
                ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
```
