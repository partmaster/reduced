## Features

This package is an implementation of the 'reduced' API on top of the Binder state management framework.

## Getting started

Add the reduced_binder package and the binder package to the dependecies section of pubspec.yaml and then you can use the basic state management features through the generic 'reduced' API and avoid a deep coupling to the binder classes.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```
